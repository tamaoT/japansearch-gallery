I created a personal gallery titled "Expressions of Fish in Japanese Art" using Japan Search — a national platform that allows users to search, view, and utilize metadata from a wide range of Japanese cultural and academic resources. These include books, official documents, cultural properties, artworks, humanities, natural history, science and engineering, scholarly assets, broadcast programs, films, and more.

Japan Search is operated by the National Diet Library under the direction of the Digital Archive Promotion Council, with the cooperation of various institutions across Japan.

My gallery explores how fish — an important motif in Japanese culture — are represented in different artistic forms, from traditional paintings and woodblock prints to decorative arts and illustrations.
This project reflects both my interest in cultural heritage and the creative ways living creatures are visually expressed throughout history.
